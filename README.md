# celld

Self-hosted, distributed **Durable Objects**.

celld is an open-source daemon that runs Cloudflare Workers and Durable
Objects on your own machines. Each object is its own SQLite database.
celld addresses an object by name and replicates it to a bucket that you
own. The bucket can be S3-compatible, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure
Blob Storage. The nodes coordinate through that bucket alone, with no
control plane and no consensus. Because every object is its own small
database, applications shard by construction — the contention and
blast-radius failures of one shared database are designed out, not
managed. A cell that no node holds is inactive, and an inactive cell
costs nearly nothing. Learn more at
[celld.dev](https://celld.dev) or read the
[documentation](https://celld.dev/docs).

## How it works

Every `celld` node embeds V8 and executes Wrangler bundles. The fleet shares
one bucket, which contains deployments, cell state, and small ownership
records. The bucket can be S3-compatible, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure
Blob Storage. Object-storage compare-and-swap ensures that exactly one
node owns a cell at a time, without a membership protocol, failure
detector, or consensus service.

celld continuously replicates each cell's SQLite database to the bucket.
When a cell moves, or when an inactive cell activates, its new owner restores
that database and resumes execution. The bucket is the durable source of
truth; nodes are replaceable.

## Install

The installer downloads the `celld` binary (provenance is verifiable with
`gh attestation verify`):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://celld.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Put `~/.local/bin` on your `PATH` if the installer asks you to.

Worker projects deployed with `celld deploy` need
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) on `PATH`; asset-only projects do not.

The installer keeps each release under `~/.local/lib/celld/releases` and points
one symlink at the current one. To remove celld, delete the symlink and the
releases:

```sh
rm `which celld` && rm -rf ~/.local/lib/celld
```

## Container

The release image contains the `celld` binary and is published for Linux
x86-64 and ARM64:

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/denoland/celld --version
```

Persist the runtime's local state and pass the standard AWS credential
environment through:

```sh
docker volume create celld-state
docker run --rm --network host \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
  -e CELLD_WATCH=/var/lib/celld/state \
  -v celld-state:/var/lib/celld \
  ghcr.io/denoland/celld \
  --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket \
  --endpoint https://ACCOUNT.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
  --region auto \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --internal-listen 10.0.0.12:8081 \
  --advertise node-a.internal:8081
```

Drop `--endpoint` and `--region` for AWS S3. Expose port 8080 through the load
balancer, and keep port 8081 on the private network.

### Local Agents and Code Mode stack

The repository's Compose stack builds celld from the current checkout, starts
MinIO and a deterministic model-provider double, creates a local bucket,
deploys the pinned [`agents-conformance`](examples/agents-conformance/README.md)
application, and starts celld with Worker Loader enabled:

```sh
# Override this when running another copy of the lab at the same time.
export CELLD_COMPOSE_PROJECT=celld-behavioral
docker compose up --build -d celld
docker compose --profile test run --rm e2e
```

The E2E runner waits for celld and then exercises two independently named
Agents, state and SQL isolation, Workspace files, Worker Shell, Worker
JavaScript and loader modules, streamed chat and resume, the HTTP AI adapter,
and delayed Agent scheduling. Each check prints a `PASS` line. The stack
publishes no host ports: celld, MinIO, and the model provider communicate only
on the Compose project network, so the lab cannot collide with another stack's
host listeners. Use a throwaway client container on that network for manual
requests, for example:

```sh
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint node e2e -e \
  'fetch("http://celld:8080/conformance/names").then(async (r) => console.log(await r.text()))'
```

After changing the Worker fixture, deploy it again and restart the node because
running nodes intentionally retain the deployment they loaded at startup:

```sh
docker compose run --rm deployer
docker compose restart celld
```

Inspect or stop the stack with:

```sh
docker compose logs -f celld
docker compose down           # keep local MinIO/celld data
docker compose down --volumes # reset the entire lab
```

The Compose credentials are fixed local-development values. MinIO Community
Edition does not satisfy celld's production fencing support contract, so this
single-node lab explicitly disables the startup storage-provider probe. Never
reuse this Compose topology, its credentials, or that probe override for a
production fleet.

For the current published Agents SDK chat contract, use the separate
credential-free [`agents-current-conformance`](examples/agents-current-conformance/README.md)
target. It pins `agents@0.21.0`, `@cloudflare/ai-chat@0.10.2`, and a compatible
AI SDK/OpenAI adapter lane; exercises standard named HTTP/WebSocket routing;
and verifies multi-event model streaming, durable messages, bounded errors,
schema-validated durable memory and reminder tools, idempotent schedules,
owner-scoped cancellation, alarm wake-up, synchronized completion broadcasts,
named isolation, and reconnect reads after inactivity. Compose keeps the legacy target as its
default and selects the current target with
`CELLD_CONFORMANCE_FIXTURE=agents-current-conformance`.

## Run it

celld uses the standard AWS credential chain. Deploy to an S3-compatible
bucket, then start celld against the same bucket:

```sh
celld deploy . \
  --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket

celld \
  --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --internal-listen 10.0.0.12:8081 \
  --advertise 10.0.0.12:8081
```

Use `--endpoint` for another S3-compatible service and `--region` when it
cannot be inferred. A `gs://` bucket selects Google Cloud Storage. celld then
uses the Cloud Storage XML API with generation preconditions. Authentication
uses Application Default Credentials. celld rejects an S3 `--endpoint` for a
`gs://` bucket, and it ignores the storage region:

```sh
celld deploy . --bucket gs://my-cells-bucket
celld --bucket gs://my-cells-bucket --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --internal-listen 10.0.0.12:8081 --advertise 10.0.0.12:8081
```

An `az://` bucket selects Azure Blob Storage, where the NAME is the
container. The storage account comes from `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`.
celld requires exactly one storage account key, managed identity, or workload
identity. An AKS workload identity uses `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`,
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`.
The authority host must identify the public Azure cloud. A Microsoft Entra
identity needs data-plane permission to read, write, list, and delete blobs.
The `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role supplies these permissions. celld
rejects an S3 `--endpoint` for an `az://` bucket, and it ignores the storage
region. celld qualifies an `az://` bucket: the conditional-write contract and
the multipart upload path were tested against a live Azure account on
2026-08-18, under each of the three credential families named above. See
[ownership and fencing](docs/fencing.md):

```sh
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=myaccount
celld deploy . --bucket az://my-cells-container
celld --bucket az://my-cells-container --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --internal-listen 10.0.0.12:8081 --advertise 10.0.0.12:8081
```

A fleet runs one application, and every node loads its
latest successfully committed deployment from `deploy/current.json`. Run
`celld --help` for the complete command line.
Deployment objects use the documented types in `crates/celld/protocol.rs`. `celld
deploy` invokes `esbuild` from `PATH` for Worker code, accepts the supported
Wrangler config subset—including co-deployed or asset-only static
assets—and writes those objects directly. Every node discovers owners and
peers from bucket leases; there is no account or join service.

Peer HTTP and the operator API use the internal listener. Put every advertised
address on a trusted private network or an encrypted overlay such as WireGuard
or Tailscale. Do not publish the internal port. celld rejects a literal public
IP unless you supply `--unsafe-public-advertise`. An explicit advertised
address requires an explicit internal-listener address. celld cannot verify a
hostname or a translated port, so you must route the advertised address to the
internal listener. The first current node creates `fleet/peer-auth.json` in the
bucket. All peer requests are
protocol-versioned, body-bound, HMAC-authenticated, clock-bounded, and
replay-protected with that fleet secret. Treat access to the bucket and its
credentials as fleet administrator access.

## Operate a fleet

`celld diagnose` enumerates every node lease by default, then performs a signed
direct probe of each live peer:

```sh
celld diagnose --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket
```

The report keeps checking after an individual failure and distinguishes
expired records, malformed or unsafe advertise addresses, unreachable peers,
and incompatible protocols. It also prints each node's coarse resident-cell,
WebSocket, RSS, CPU, file-descriptor, pressure, and shedding sample. Pass one
or more `--peer NODE_ID` options to restrict the check.

`celld d1` runs SQL and migrations against a deployed D1 database. It finds a
node through the same node leases, and that node sends the work to the node
that owns the database:

```sh
celld d1 migrations apply ledger --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket
```

Set a hard resident-cell limit on each loaded node:

```sh
CELLD_MAX_RESIDENT_CELLS=1000 \
celld --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --internal-listen 10.0.0.12:8081 --advertise node-a.internal:8081
```

celld enables a memory threshold at 80% of the available memory by default. Set
`CELLD_MAX_RSS_MB` to change the threshold, or set it to `0` to disable memory
pressure shedding. celld measures the memory that the cells hold, and not the
resident set size of the process. The two differ, because the memory allocator
keeps some freed pages instead of returning them to the operating system.
Shedding a cell cannot return those pages, so a threshold on the resident set
size holds a node in pressure after the node gives every cell back. The `/state`
route reports both numbers.

celld also applies an absolute cap to the resident set size of the process. The
cap is 95% of the available memory. It protects the node when the allocator
holds memory that shedding cannot return, because the operating system stops a
process that uses more memory than the machine has. The node logs a warning when
this cap applies.

The cap is a share of the machine, and celld does not derive it from the
threshold. A `CELLD_MAX_RSS_MB` at or above 95% of the available memory therefore reaches
the cap. The cap is then the effective limit. The node decides on its resident
set size, and celld reports this at startup. `CELLD_MAX_RSS_MB=0`
disables the threshold and the cap together. When celld cannot read the size of
the available memory, it applies a cap of 125% of an explicit threshold.

Each isolate also has a V8 heap limit, and this limit is separate from the
memory of the node. The default is 128 MB, and it matches the limit of a
Durable Object on Cloudflare. Set `CELLD_V8_HEAP_LIMIT_MB` to change it. The
limit decides how much state one isolate can hold, so it decides how many
hibernatable WebSocket clients a cell can carry. Each client holds state in the
heap. A cell holds approximately 50,000 clients with the default limit, and it
needs approximately 512 MB to hold 100,000 clients.

An isolate that uses more than 90% of this limit refuses a new hibernatable
WebSocket, and the error names the heap. The refusal is not permanent, and the
isolate accepts a WebSocket again when the use of the heap falls under 90%.

An isolate that reaches the limit stops more than an accept. It also stops the
materialization of a SQL result set, and that error names the heap too. celld
measures the heap before each event, and the isolate serves again when the use
of the heap falls under 75% of the limit. An idle isolate holds a dead heap
until something allocates again, so celld forces a collection when a
measurement is above that share. A restart of the process is not necessary.

Under pressure, celld durably replicates and fences the least-recently used idle
cells. It then publishes the cells as unowned without resetting their epochs.
Those cells become inactive, and celld refuses to reacquire new unowned cells.

Each limit releases separately. The threshold releases when the memory in use
falls to 80% of the threshold. The cap releases when the resident set size falls
to 80% of the cap. A crossing of one limit therefore does not hold the node
against the other.

A spare receives no assignment. It acquires a released cell through the same
bucket protocol when normal traffic reaches it. celld does not shed a cell with
active work or a live host WebSocket.
