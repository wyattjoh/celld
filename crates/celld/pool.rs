// Isolate admission and deadlines are in the V8 arm outside the World.
#![allow(clippy::disallowed_macros, clippy::disallowed_methods)]

//! The isolate pool: the shell around `celld_logic::isolate`.
//!
//! One multi-threaded tokio runtime owns every socket and timer. Isolates
//! belong to no thread — `v8::Locker` installs the entering thread's
//! per-isolate state, so any worker can take an isolate and run a turn in it.
//! This module owns the isolates and the counters; every choice about which
//! isolate, when to grow, what to shed and what to retire is made by
//! `celld_logic::isolate` and merely performed here.
//!
//! **The gate exists so nothing blocks.** `SharedIsolate::lock()` blocks
//! until its holder releases. Every path here takes the slot's async permit
//! first, so that blocking lock is uncontended by construction. A `lock()`
//! reached without the permit would park a tokio worker on V8, which is the
//! one thing this runtime refuses to do.
